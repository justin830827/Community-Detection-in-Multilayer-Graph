# Graph Data Mining

This Capstone Project aims to solve community detection in multilayers graph.

## Environment to test the script

This project has been tested on `CSC591_ADBI_v3` VCL environment.

## Packages requirments

Please ensure the packages have been installed beforehand, or run the following command to install:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to run the script

After download the zip, first unzip the zip file and get into the folder.

```
unzip capstone.zip
cd capstone
```

Once the path is under `capstone`, please run the command in following format.

```
python3 main.py
```

After the program complete, the results of program will display on terminal and plots will be saved in `./results`.

## Description of Dataset

This dataset is downloaded from [link](http://multilayer.it.uu.se/datasets.html). In this graph, the multiple layers represent relationships between 61 employees of a University department in five different aspects: (i) coworking, (ii) having lunch together, (iii) Facebook friendship, (iv) o‚úèine friendship (having fun together), and (v) coauthor-ship.
